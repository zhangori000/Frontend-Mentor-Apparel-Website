    the website is displayed in two sections. right, left. left is also an image. add svg for logo and the icon for button and also a red text under submit form.
    Immediately what florin did was create a big container. and within the container two more containers!
    a right and a left. for the right class he added a class of bg-image
    to add icon, he just used the img tag. img *src *alt 

    heading:
    has something different use span.

    form:
    add a small tag 
    input: 
    type email
    button: 
    icon arrow. so instead of text like "click me" its an image. alt is arrow.
    error icon the error icon should have a class isnce we gon do something to it.
